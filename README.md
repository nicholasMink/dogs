## Dangerous Dogs in ATX

This application displays dogs declared to be dangerous in and around Austin, Texas. It uses the official City of Austin open data portal to retrieve data.

>"No declared Dangerous Dog in the City of Austin and Travis County should ever be running at large. They are court ordered to be restrained at all times and should be wearing a large tag identifying them as a Dangerous Dog. They have attacked in the past. The owner is required to provide $100,000 in financial responsibility. If they attack again the court could order them put to sleep."
